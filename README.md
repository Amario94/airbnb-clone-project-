## 🧰 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project utilizes a modern and scalable technology stack to deliver a responsive, secure, and feature-rich web application. Each technology plays a specific role in the overall architecture:

| Technology      | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Django**        | A high-level Python web framework used to build robust RESTful APIs and handle backend logic efficiently. |
| **PostgreSQL**    | A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data like user profiles, bookings, and listings. |
| **GraphQL**       | A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility over REST. |
| **React.js**      | A frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, such as property listings and booking forms. |
| **HTML5/CSS3**    | Markup and styling technologies used to structure and design the application’s layout and appearance. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Core scripting language for adding interactivity and logic on the frontend. |

## 🗄️ Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a relational data model to manage users, listings, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the key entities, their core fields, and how they relate to each other.

### 🧑 Users
Stores information about platform users, including both guests and hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `full_name`
- `email` (unique)
- `password_hash`
- `role` (guest or host)

### 🏠 Properties
Represents properties listed by hosts on the platform.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `host_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `title`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`

**Relationship:**  
A user (host) can create multiple properties.

### 📅 Bookings
Stores information about reservation activity between users and properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties)

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships Summary

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (if a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Booking** can have one **Payment**.
- A **User** can write multiple **Reviews**, each tied to a **Property** they booked.

This design ensures data consistency and supports key functionalities like searching properties, processing payments, and managing user feedback.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features that form the foundation of the Airbnb Clone Project. Each feature is designed to contribute to a seamless and user-friendly experience for both guests and hosts.

### 👤 User Management
Users can sign up, log in, update their profile, and log out securely. The system supports different roles (guests and hosts), enabling tailored experiences based on the user type.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, upload images, and manage listing details like pricing, amenities, and availability. This allows them to attract guests and monetize their spaces.

### 📅 Booking System
Guests can view availability, select dates, and book properties in real-time. This feature handles date validation, avoids double bookings, and stores reservation history.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Secure payment processing allows users to pay for their bookings using credit/debit cards or other methods. Payments are tracked and linked to booking records for transparency.

### 🌟 Review & Rating System
After a completed stay, guests can rate and review properties. This builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions based on authentic feedback.

### 🔍 Search and Filter
Users can search for properties by location, dates, price range, and other filters. This enhances the browsing experience and helps users quickly find suitable accommodations.

### 📬 Notifications (Optional/Advanced)
Email or in-app notifications are used to confirm bookings, alert hosts about new reservations, and remind users of upcoming stays.

---

Each of these features is essential to delivering a functional, interactive, and real-world booking experience, closely replicating the core functionality of platforms like Airbnb.

## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of the application and its users is a top priority in the Airbnb Clone Project. APIs serve as the backbone of communication between the frontend and backend, and protecting them is critical to maintaining data integrity, privacy, and trust.

### 🔑 Authentication
**Description:**  
All users must verify their identity through secure login methods before accessing protected routes. We will implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens).

**Importance:**  
Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing personal data, user accounts, or sensitive actions like booking and payments.

---

### 🛡️ Authorization
**Description:**  
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users only perform actions allowed by their role (e.g., guests cannot edit other users’ listings).

**Importance:**  
Authorization protects system integrity by restricting access to features based on user roles, preventing misuse or data manipulation.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
**Description:**  
API endpoints will be protected with rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., too many login attempts, excessive search queries).

**Importance:**  
Rate limiting reduces the risk of brute force attacks, service overload, and denial-of-service (DoS) scenarios.

---

### 🧊 Data Encryption
**Description:**  
Sensitive data (like passwords and payment details) will be encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., hashed passwords using bcrypt).

**Importance:**  
Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted or accessed improperly, it remains unreadable and protected from theft.

---

### 📦 Input Validation & Sanitization
**Description:**  
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized on both frontend and backend to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.

**Importance:**  
Sanitization protects the application from malicious input that could compromise functionality or leak sensitive data.

---

### 💳 Secure Payments
**Description:**  
Payments will be processed through trusted third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe or Paystack), never storing raw card data directly.

**Importance:**  
Using secure and compliant gateways ensures financial transactions are protected and meets industry security standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).

---

These security measures are essential to safeguarding users, maintaining platform integrity, and building a trusted online booking experience.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production environments using automated workflows. This reduces manual effort, speeds up development cycles, and ensures high-quality code delivery.

### Why It's Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in the Airbnb Clone Project helps:
- **Catch bugs early** through automated testing during integration.
- **Speed up deployment** by automating build and release steps.
- **Improve code quality** with continuous checks and formatting tools.
- **Enhance collaboration** by maintaining consistent development environments.

This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and improvements are shipped faster and more reliably, without interrupting the user experience.

### Recommended CI/CD Tools

| Tool              | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Actions** | Automate testing, linting, and deployment directly from GitHub workflows. |
| **Docker**         | Containerize the application to ensure consistency across environments. |
| **Heroku / Render / Vercel** | Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers to automatically deploy builds from GitHub. |
| **Postman/Newman** | Automate API testing during the CI pipeline. |
| **Coverage.py / Jest** | Tools for measuring test coverage in backend and frontend codebases. |

---

By integrating CI/CD, the team ensures a smoother development process and a faster, more stable delivery pipeline from code to production.
