## 🧰 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project utilizes a modern and scalable technology stack to deliver a responsive, secure, and feature-rich web application. Each technology plays a specific role in the overall architecture:

| Technology      | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Django**        | A high-level Python web framework used to build robust RESTful APIs and handle backend logic efficiently. |
| **PostgreSQL**    | A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data like user profiles, bookings, and listings. |
| **GraphQL**       | A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility over REST. |
| **React.js**      | A frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, such as property listings and booking forms. |
| **HTML5/CSS3**    | Markup and styling technologies used to structure and design the application’s layout and appearance. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Core scripting language for adding interactivity and logic on the frontend. |
| **Node.js**       | (Optional, if used with Django) Can handle microservices, real-time features, or middleware integrations. |
| **Docker**        | Used to containerize the application and ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. |
| **Git & GitHub**  | Version control tools used for tracking changes, collaborating with the team, and deploying project updates. |
| **Heroku / Render / Vercel** | Cloud platforms used for hosting and deploying the application. |
